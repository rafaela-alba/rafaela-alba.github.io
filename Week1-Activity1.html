	<p>  <em>How can two income couples manage their cash flow without just lumping everything together?</em> I feel like everyone I talk
to has some convuluted system of accounts and credit cards or <strong>complete chaos</strong>. In either case, they are probably letting too much
money sit in an account that earns very little return, they are over drafting that account, or they have to spend hours and hours tracking individual
expenditures.</p>
