    <h2 align="center">Iceland</h2>
    <p><b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice
    coexist. Where dark winters are offset by  the summer's midnight sun. A country
    where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

        <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and
        the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot
        for this magnificent lightshow.<br>
        The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon
        created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field.
        This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

        <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake—namely,
           its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place
           mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are
           offered from Reykjavík (and Skaftafell).</p>
