    <p>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth’s atmosphere—at altitudes from 60
       to more than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result
       is a colorful, dancing light show.</p>

    <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accessible
      places if you’d like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider
      anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.</p>

    <p> In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily
     the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles interact
     with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant
     temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.</p>
