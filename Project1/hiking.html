    <p><em>Glacier</em> Experience is a small group experience that offers an easy glacier hike on Sólheimajökull
       glacier with an experienced glacier guide and is available all year around. The tour offers a pick-up
       from Reykjavík or a meet on location at Sólheimajökull glacier. Add even more adventure to your stay
       in Iceland and come explore this amazing crawling glacier with us.</p>

    <p>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland’s
       most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to
       the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true
       reason behind the name Ice-land! </p>
